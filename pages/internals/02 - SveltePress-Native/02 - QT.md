# QT

The QT version uses [NodeGui](https://github.com/nodegui/). Similarly to GTK, it uses the Sidebar to populate the widgets.

`prepareMeta.mjs` renames files and folders using handlebars, to match the current title from the SveltePress config.

`prepareAssets.js` copies the `static/` folder to the QT directories so they get included in the builds.

Markdown gets converted by calling `MDConverter.js` real-time! The HTML then gets sent to the QTextBrowser which renders it.

`package.json` includes many scripts that help with packing and building, read the readme for more!
